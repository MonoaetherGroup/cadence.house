<h1>Typical cases</h1>

<h2>Overloaded CEO</h2>
<p>A global CEO brings in an outside presence after exhausting consultants and analysts. In 90 minutes, one sentence cuts through: “both of your options lead to the same wall.” Decision made. Value immediate.</p>

<h2>Board deadlock</h2>
<p>A board stuck for months on a merger invites an out-of-frame advisor. The real question emerges: “are you ready to lose control?” Silence. Decision follows. Investment justified.</p>

<h2>Individual at the end of the road</h2>
<p>After coaches, therapists, and healers failed, nothing held. A 60-minute session is enough: “your problem is that you’re still looking for a problem.” The cycle ends. Life resumes.</p>

<h2>International organization</h2>
<p>A think tank hires a discreet advisor for a critical energy security meeting. No slides, no promise. One presence, one reformulation: “you debate the future, but no one speaks of the cost of the present.” Priorities shift, strategy clarifies.</p>

<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In a ministerial council, a neutral outsider is paid to cut through confusion. His remark: “you seek consensus before you have clarity.” The debate lightens, the decision passes. An hour well spent.</p>
