<h1>For whom?</h1>

<p><strong>You carry heavy decisions.</strong> Information piles up. Analyses cancel each other. Nothing cuts through.</p>
<p><strong>You already know.</strong> The frame no longer holds. Waiting costs more than deciding. You seek useful friction.</p>

<p><strong>Individuals.</strong> You tried coaches, therapists, healers. Nothing held. Here: no method, no promise. A presence. A clarity.</p>

<p><strong>Format.</strong> 60–90 minutes. <strong>Entry threshold:</strong> 3,690&nbsp;CHF. Board sessions are priced higher.</p>
